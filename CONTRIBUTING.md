## Contributing to an existing issue

### Finding an issue to work on

You can view the list of issues [here](https://bitbucket.org/xadamy/nodejs-project-template/issues/). The issues are labelled, so you can use the labels to get an idea of which issue could be a good fit for you. (Here's [a good article](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/finding-your-first-open-source-project-or-bug-to-work-on-1712f651e5ba) on how to find your first bug to fix).

Before getting to work, take a look at the issue and at the conversation around it. Has someone already offered to work on the issue? Has someone been assigned to the issue? If so, you might want to check with them to see whether they're still actively working on it.

If the issue is a few months old, it might be a good idea to write a short comment to double-check that the issue or feature is still a valid one to jump on.

Feel free to ask for more detail on what is expected: are there any more details or specifications you need to know?

And if at any point you get stuck: don't hesitate to ask for help.
